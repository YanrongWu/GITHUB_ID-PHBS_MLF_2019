## 1  Introduction & Project Goal

### 1.1 Introduction

![Interest rate](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/Figures/Interest%20rate.png)  

Economic recession is one of the most important economic phenomenon in macroeconomics. Predicting economic decline has always been a tricky but attractive topic. Due to the gaming of the market and the excessively complex elements included in the market, predicting the time point of economic decline has almost become an unsolvable problem in history. 

Referring to the professor's suggestion, our group decided to launch the project to practice the programming methods learned in the class to preliminarily explore the effect on financial recession, which is generated from the relationship between short-term market interest rates and long-term market interest rates on financial weakness. This project attempts to construct multiple indicator variables based on the interest rates of different financial products in different periods, and seeks the contribution of these indicator variables by machine learning method, moreover, for the chance to get more details of the theoretical explanation of economic recession.

### 1.2 Project Goal
When the gap between the long-term bonds and short-term bonds shrinks, it always indicates that the market anticipates the interest rates will fall in future as a hedge to upcoming downturn. In some extreme circumstances, this indicator can even alert the recession of the stock market. Our goal is to capture this relationship and make the model useful for recession prediction.  

## 2  Data Acquisition and Data Selection
### 2.1 Raw Data Acquisition
1. We download the YTM (yield to maturity) of the US treasuries with various duration range from 1 month to 30 years,from [fred.stlouisfed.org](http://fred.stlouisfed.org). The data is arranged by daily data and the time span from 1962 to the present. You can see in the [Yield_newVersion.csv](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/data/Yield_newVersion.csv)

2. Considering that only use the data of the YTM of treasuries maybe not sufficient，we collect more data contains the volatility of the stock market and the changes of the monthly economic indicators such as the rate of unemployment and core CPI from [Wind](https://www.wind.com.cn/). The raw data is stored in:

[DJ_weekly.csv](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/data/DJ_weekly.csv) for weekly price and volatility data of DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) index.

[Economic_data.csv](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/data/Economic_data.csv) for monthly CPI and unemployment rate.

### 2.2 Data Description and Data Selection

#### 2.2.1 Imbalance Problem of Y Data

-  Discrete value to illustrate recession

  According to [NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee](http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html), important recessions of US is illustrated in the table below:

  ![US_Business_Cycle](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/Figures/US_Business_Cycle.png)

  According to the table, we can define the period between the peak and through of an cycle as recession interval. For example, the ***December 1969*** is a peak of an cycle and ***November 1970*** is the through of the same cycle. As a result, we can define the ***December 1969 to November 1970*** as an recession.

  Our process model of the fact is class all the date between an recession as 1 and 0 for others, which means that all ***y*** during the interval like ***December 1969 to November 1970*** is 1 and the others is 0

- Other Definition Recession Index 

  - Applying "The Econbrowser Recession Indicator Index"

  - Generated by Macroeconomic data according to Unemployment Rate, etc

    • ***Weekly return:*** DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) weekly return at the date

    • ***Return of past month:*** DJIA accumulated monthly return of the last month

    • ***Return of past half year:*** DJIA accumulated return of the last half year

    • ***Return of past year:*** DJIA accumulated return of the last year

    • ***Volatility:*** Volatility of DJIA this week

    • ***Average weekly Volatility of past month:*** the average of weekly Volatility of DJIA last month

    • ***Average weekly Volatility of past quarter:*** the average of weekly Volatility of DJIA last quarter

    ***Tips:***

    ***Consering the YTM is daily data but the date in the [DJ_weekly.csv](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/data/DJ_weekly.csv) and 
    [Economic_data.csv](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/data/Economic_data.csv) are arranged in weekly or monthly data. As a result, for everyday, we chose to trace back to the first accessable date to fill in the blanks in the features.***

- In the End, We decided take "The Econbrowser Recession Indicator Index" as the recession index in our project. Because ... ...

#### 2.2.2 Treasury Yield and Recession

In our following process, we will use data from 1962.

#### 2.2.3 Corporate Bond and Recession

#### 2.2.4 The Rate of Change upon Short-Term Yield and Recession

according to the the article, ... ...

#### 2.2.5 Only Take Treasury Yields as Components for X Side

The table below illustrates the summary of the potential features we get**

![Features](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/Figures/data.png)

•	***DGS1:*** The YTM of the one-year US treasury 

•	***DGS3:*** The YTM of the 3-year US treasury 

•	***DGS5:*** The YTM of the 5-year US treasury 

## 3  Feature Engineering - Feature Extraction and Generalized
### 3.1 Combination of Different Treasury Yields with Different Weights

***10M1*** means the difference of YTM of 10-year US treasury and 1-year US treasury. ***10M3***, ***10M5***, ***5M3***, ***5M1*** have the same meaning.

### 3.2 Tuning Lag between Term Spread  Curve and Recession Index

Considering that our target is to predict the likelihood of the recession occur. It's meaningless to use the synchronized features and classification. ***The classification result in the table below in fact is delayed for six months, which means that the y of 2000/1/1 is the division of 2000/7/1 which is six month later.***

### 3.3 Feature Extraction through PCA


## 4. Experiment on ML models

### 4.1 Overview

#### 4.1.1 Single Term Spread

> At the first stage of our model, we want to just use the features of interest spread to predict the recession. We take the ***10M1*** and ***10M3*** as the features and the result of classification as the ***y***. ***We totally have about 170000 daily data***
>
> We tried three models(LR,SVM and Tree), by dividing the dataset into training and validation set, we can get the accuracy for both of them. At the same time, we also use confusion matrix to assess model performance. By changing the numbers of data in the training set, we can find the best division of the dataset for each model.

- which pair of yields
- what weight for each yield
- how long is the lag
- which ML model to apply

#### 4.1.2 Multiple Term Spread

- additionally, apply feature extraction technology

### 4.2 Experiment Cases

> - Traditional Model：LR
>
> ![learning curve figure lr](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/Figures/LR.png)
>
> For LR model, we can see the validation accuracy is stable as around ***86%*** as the changing of the scale of traning set, which means that if we wants to improve the performance further, maybe more features is necessary.
>
> - Traditional Model：SVC
>
> ![learning curve figure svc](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/Figures/SVM.png)
>
> For SVC model, we can see the validation accuracy is indeed improving as we distribute more data for traning ***(propotion from 0.1 to 0.3)***, but stable after 0.3. The optimal accuracy is around ***83%*** which is worse than LR.
>
> - Traditional Model：Desicion Tree
>
> ![learning curve figure tree](https://github.com/YanrongWu/YanrongWu-PHBS_MLF_2019/blob/master/Final%20Group%20Project/Figures/Tree.png)  
>
>
> For Desicion Tree model, we can see the validation accuracy is improving as the proportion of traning set ***changing from 0.1 to 0.2)***, but stable after 0.2. The optimal accuracy is around ***86%*** which is similar to LR.

## 5  Experiment Assessment and Results

|      | Model | Pair of Yields | Weight(L/S) | accuracy | Learning Curve |
| ---- | ----- | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| E1*  |       |                |             |          |                |
| E2   |       |                |             |          |                |

|      |       |                |             |          |                |

*the 1st experiment case

## 6  Analytical Interpretation

> Comparing the three traditional model, we can see that ***by changing the scale of training set, we can only get an optimal accuracy about 86%***, We think this result is not very satisfying. However, continue to exploit the data of interest spread is not effective any more and we think more features is needed. At the same time, we think we can also do more upgrade on the designing of the model and feature so we wants to develop an new model in the following part.

## 7  Conclusion

> - Model-Upgrade Version to Cover the features of Stock Market and Short-term Economic data (Still Working Now)
> - *1) As we have get the data of the performance of the stock market and real economy, we think we can build a score based on the features because the real economy can be seen as the result of the recession, it's always a little bit  behind the actual economy. At the same time, the stock market can be seen as an anticipation of the future which means it will goes down and recover earlier than the real economy. We think by combination of the two categories together, we can build an reasonable score for defining the stage of the economy.*
> - 2) When we reasonably defined the algorithm of score computing, we are going to use the methods we have implemented in the simple version model. After that, we will compare the performance of the two model. In our expectation, our new model can significantly improve the accuracy on predicting
