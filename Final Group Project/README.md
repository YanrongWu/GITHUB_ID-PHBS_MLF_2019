## 1. Introduction

Economic recession is one of the most important economic phenomenon in macroeconomics. Predicting economic decline has always been a tricky but attractive topic. Due to the gaming of the market and the excessively complex elements included in the market, predicting the time point of economic decline has almost become an unsolvable problem in history. 

Referring to the professor's suggestion, our group decided to launch the project to practice the programming methods learned in the class to preliminarily explore the effect on financial recession, which is generated from the relationship between short-term market interest rates and long-term market interest rates on financial weakness. This project attempts to construct multiple indicator variables based on the interest rates of different financial products in different periods, and seeks the contribution of these indicator variables by machine learning method, moreover, for the chance to get more details of the theoretical explanation of economic recession.

## 2. Project Goal
When the gap between the long-term bonds and short-term bonds shrinks, it always indicates that the market anticipates the interest rates will fall in future as a hedge to upcoming downturn. In some extreme circumstances, this indicator can even alert the recession of the stock market. Our goal is to capture this relationship and make the model useful for recession prediction.  

## 3. Data Acquisition and Description
### 1. We download the YTM (yield to maturity) of the US treasuries with various duration range from 1 month to 30 years,from from [fred.stlouisfed.org](fred.stlouisfed.org)
### 2. Considering that only use the data of the YTM of treasuries maybe not sufficient，we collect more data contains the volatility of the stock market and the changes of the monthly economic indicators such as the rate of unemployment and core CPI
The table below illustrates the summary of the data:
We get 49 original features from [fred.stlouisfed.org](fred.stlouisfed.org), which are various interests rate for different financial  products and a bunch of different values of some of those. Please see the appendix for details

The rule of thumb definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. This definition was coined in a 1974 New York Times article from the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who also suggested several other measurements. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines an economic recession as: "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales." NBER is the authority on recessions, especially when we look at when they started and when they ended.  

A Yield Curve is a graph depicting the different interest rates for similar financial instruments of different maturities.
The following figures show the different yield curve after 1990.

A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth(GDP), as such we can obtain the dates that fit this description from the St Louis Federal Research Economic Database. This time series takes binary form, with 1 denoting a recession period and 0 other wise.

In our following process, we will use data from 1962.

## 6. Model（学弟跑完SVM那三个传统算法可以将结果放上来）
However, this fact is not detailed enough to guide predictions. Firstly, we need to define what is a recession, 20% down of the stock market or even serious? Secondly, the collapse will not follow the contraction closely, markets need time to digest, so we need a digest time range from a quarter to a year. The difference of the observation period will also affect the result of the define of recession. Lastly, we wonder whether there is a threshold value that when the linear combination of the return rate of short-term and long-term exceed the value, the possibility of recession can be significantly enhanced.  

As a result, we will add the features below into our model,   
1) Observation period: range from a month to a year;  
2) Threshold of the linear combination of the return rate such as: Ay – Bx< c;   
3) Definition of the recession: range from 10% to 50%.  

When we defined the features and processed the data, we will divide the set into train and test, then we will build a model use classifier such as logistic regression and decision tree to maximize the accuracy on the test set. Use this model we can do our predict of the next recession.
